In the golden age where wisdom shone bright,
In lands where scholars sought the light,
Where caliphs and poets cast their ink,
A thirst for knowledge was the link.

From Baghdad's libraries, grand and vast,
To Cordoba's halls where wisdom amassed,
Scholars and seekers, hearts aflame,
Chased every whisper of knowledge's name.

Ibn Sina's pen, a guiding star,
Al-Khwarizmi's numbers traveled far,
Al-Farabi's thoughts, a gentle stream,
Flowed into minds like a vivid dream.

They taught us that the world's expanse,
Could be unraveled with a glance,
Into the books, the scrolls, the lore,
A universe to explore.

Seek knowledge, for it lights the way,
Through darkest night and brightest day,
An endless quest, a boundless flight,
A lantern in the thick of night.

For in the quest, we find our grace,
The secret paths, the hidden place,
Where wisdom waits with open hands,
To guide us through the shifting sands.

So let us learn, and never cease,
To seek the truths that bring us peace,
For in each question, every why,
A spark of knowledge lights the sky.
